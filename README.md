## About example programs

These are some programs that I have found online. I did not write any of them.

* **bench.bf** Found on [here](https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks/tree/master/brainfuck). Shows the alphabets in a reverse order.
* **mandelbrot.bf** Found on [here](https://github.com/kostya/benchmarks/tree/master/brainfuck). Prints a beautiful Mandelbrot set.
* **hanoi.bf** Found on [here](https://github.com/fabianishere/brainfuck/blob/master/examples/hanoi.bf). Solves the Tower of Hanoi problem.
* **long.bf** Obtained from [bfc](https://github.com/barracks510/bfc) repositiory.
* **oobrain.bf** Obtained from [here](https://github.com/Borisvl/brainfuck/blob/master/src/test/resources/bf/oobrain.b). Used for testing proper `u8` handling.
